Your laptops hard drive can fail for any of several reasons. If you haven't
backed up your files, it's possible you'll never see them again. In the case
of a thesis for example, this can be a very frustrating event.

Preferably you back up your files by copying them to one or more external
harddrives, although even copying to a USB drive is better than nothing.

You can also make use of a cloud storage service to keep a copy of your files,
which also allows easy access to the files from different devices. For example,
your lasted compiled PDF is accessible on your phone by using the cloud storage
service's app. That allows for more easy sharing. As the cloud storage service
you can choose for example [OneDrive](/latex/configuration/backup/onedrive)
or [Google Drive](/latex/configuration/backup/googledrive).

For large projects, the most professional solution is to also use source control,
where each time you have made some progress you create a sort of checkpoint,
allowing you to see what has changed at each moment of time. For example, if suddenly
there are compilation errors, you can see what has changed or revert to the previous
version. In the section [GitHub](/latex/configuration/backup/github), you read
how to create such a source control using Git, and how to synchronize it to the
GitHub servers.
