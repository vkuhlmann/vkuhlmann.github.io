# Always: Back-up!

Your computer's hard drive can fail for any of several reasons. If you have not
backed up your files, you might have lost them permanently. In the case
of a thesis for example, this can be a very frustrating event.

Preferably you back up your files by copying them to one or more external
hard drives, although even copying to a USB drive is better than nothing.

You can also make use of a cloud storage service (e.g. OneDrive, Google Drive)
to keep a copy of your files, which additionally allows easy access to the files
from different devices. For example, your lasted compiled PDF is then accessible
on your phone by using the cloud storage service's app. That allows for more
easy sharing.

For large projects, the most professional solution is to also use source control,
where each time you have made some progress you create a sort of checkpoint,
allowing you to see what has changed at each moment of time. If suddenly there
are compilation errors, you can see what has changed or revert to the previous
version. With GitHub, you can create such a source control based on Git,
synchronizing it to the GitHub servers.
